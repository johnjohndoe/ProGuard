<b>ProGuard</b> is free. I wrote it for the challenge of it. And for fame and
glory, of course. You're free to use it for whatever purpose you deem useful,
as long as you respect my copyrights. In addition, you can accept the
distribution license, which provides you with some more rights for modifying

The <code>proguard.classfile</code> package is distributed under the <a
